== Miniblog

Inspired by Scanty, Webby and Homoiconic: a minimalist blogging "engine".

* Comments are handled by Disqus
* Post and their meta-data are kept under version control
* Aggressive caching instead of static generation

Data from flat-files is loaded in the database to simplify serving pages.

The project is optimized for least effort, rather than smallest codebase.
